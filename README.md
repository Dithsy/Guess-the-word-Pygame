# Guess-the-word-Pygame

Trying to create a guess the word game using Pygame as the graphics Interface.
Contributions are very welcome

-> The program randomly chooses a word from a predetermined list of words.

-> The program then informs the player the number of letters the  word has choosen

-> Player is asked to input letters to enable the player to guess letters to make up that word.


# Issues
-> The problem I`ve mainly encountered is the program checking ot of pygame before player inputs anything.


The [gues](https://github.com/Dithsy/Guess-the-word-Pygame/blob/main/gues.py) file contains the code for the game.
